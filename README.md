# PDF Knowledge Graph

This project is a 3D knowledge graph viewer for PDF files using React, TypeScript, Three.js, and react-three-fiber. Each node represents a PDF file, and edges represent connections between the PDF files. Users can visualize and interact with the nodes and edges, and edit the string values of the edge connections.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript 3D library that makes WebGL simpler.
- **react-three-fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js.
- **@react-three/drei**: A collection of useful helpers for react-three-fiber.
